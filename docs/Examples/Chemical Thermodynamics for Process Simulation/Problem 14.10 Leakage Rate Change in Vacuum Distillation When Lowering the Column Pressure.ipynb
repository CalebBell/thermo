    "In sub-atmospheric pressure distillation columns, a vacuum system removes entering air by removing a vapor stream, usually near the top of the column. If air is not removed the pressure will continue to increase, as the air itself won't condense through the condenser (unless it is cryogenic). Air can also pose a fire hazard in some cases. \n",

    "Leaks into a column are usually around flanges, through valve or pump packings, inspection or sampling ports, or manholes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of empirical correlations that can be used to estimate leakage depending on pressure. The first answer uses one of those. These are not truly `mechanistic`, however. \n",
