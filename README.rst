What is thermo?
---------------

thermo is open-source software for engineers, scientists, technicians and
anyone trying to understand the universe in more detail. It facilitates 
the retrieval of constants of chemicals, the calculation of temperature
and pressure dependent chemical properties (both thermodynamic and 
transport), the calculation of the same for chemical mixtures (including
phase equilibria), and assorted information of a regulatory or legal 
nature about chemicals.

The thermo library depends on the SciPy library to povide numerical constants,
interpolation, integration, differentiation, and numerical solving functionality.
thermo all operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is 
free of charge. thermo is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerful
functionality. If you need to know something about a chemical, give thermo a try.

Installation
------------

Get the latest version of thermo from
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thermo/

If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

    $ pip install thermo

To get the git version, run:

    $ git clone git://github.com/CalebBell/thermo.git

Documentation
-------------

thermo's documentation is available on the web:

    http://thermo.readthedocs.io/

Getting Started
---------------

The library is designed around base SI units only for development
convenience. All chemicals default to 298.15 K and 101325 Pa on 
creation, unless specified. All constant-properties are loaded on
the creation of a Chemical instance.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from thermo.chemical import Chemical
    >>> tol = Chemical('toluene')
    >>> tol.Tm, tol.Tb, tol.Tc
    (179.2, 383.75, 591.75)
    >>> tol.rho, tol.Cp, tol.k, tol.mu
    (862.2380125827527, 1706.0746129119084, 0.13034801424538045, 0.0005521951637285534)


For pure species, the phase is easily
identified, allowing for properties to be obtained without needing
to specify the phase. However, the properties are also available in the
hypothetical gas phase (when under the boiling point) and in the hypothetical
liquid phase (when above the boiling point) as these properties are needed
to evaluate mixture properties. Specity the phase of a property to be retrieved 
by appending 'l' or 'g' or 's' to the property.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> tol.rhog, tol.Cpg, tol.kg, tol.mug
    (4.032009635018902, 1126.5533755283168, 0.010736843919054837, 6.973325939594919e-06)

Creating a chemical object involves identifying the appropriate chemical by name
through a database, and retrieving all constant and temperature and pressure dependent
coefficients from Pandas DataFrames - a ~1 ms process. To obtain properties at different
conditions quickly, the method set_T has been implemented. The pressure can also be 
changed simply by setting it, but set_T must be called after it.
    
.. code-block:: python

    >>> tol.set_T(310)
    >>> tol.rho, tol.Cp, tol.k, tol.mu
    (851.1582219886011, 1743.280497511088, 0.12705495902514785, 0.00048161578053599225)
    >>> tol.P = 2E6
    >>> tol.set_T(310)
    >>> tol.rho, tol.Cp, tol.k, tol.mu
    (852.7643604407997, 1743.280497511088, 0.12773606382684732, 0.0004894942399156052)

Each property is implemented through an independent object-oriented method, based on 
the classes TDependentProperty and TPDependentProperty to allow for shared methods of
plotting, integrating, differentiating, solving, interpolating, sanity checking, and
error handling. For example, to solve for the temperature at which the vapor pressure
of toluene is 2 bar. For each property, as many methods of calculating or estimating
it are included as possible. All methods can be visualized independently:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> Chemical('toluene').VaporPressure.solve_prop(2E5)
    409.5909115602903
    >>> Chemical('toluene').SurfaceTension.plot_T_dependent_property()

Mixtures are supported and many mixing rules have been implemented. However,there is
no error handling. Inputs as mole fractions (`zs`), mass fractions (`ws`), or volume
fractions (`Vfls` or `Vfgs`) are supported. Some shortcuts are supported to predefined
mixtures.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from thermo.chemical import Mixture
    >>> vodka = Mixture(['water', 'ethanol'], Vfls=[.6, .4], T=300, P=1E5)
    >>> vodka.Prl,vodka.Prg
    (35.130757024029364, 0.9490586345579207)
    >>> air = Mixture('air', T=400, P=1e5)
    >>> air.Cp
    1013.7956176577834

Roadmap
-------

This library has been in development for three years, and has been open-sourced 
earlier than originally intended due to the rapidly developing nature of open
source. It is hoped that bugs can be identified by users, and the efforts of 
other libraries can be merged in, if those developers are interested. Also
the conveniences of the open-source infrastructure (Git, continuous integration,
coverage testing, easy installation through pypi) can help development
substantially.

This library includes a huge database of (70000+) chemicals taken from the PubChem
database (selected by the availability of CAS numbers, which all data included here 
is indexed by). Regretably, only ~20000 of those have even one chemical property
apart from metadata (molecular weight, etc.). Some niche aspects (ions, ionic 
liquids) have been poorly served by this database, and so extra databases manually
curated for these are in development. 

The Chemical and Mixture classes may be subject to considerably change in the
interests of performance in the future. Because of this, they have been poorly
documented and tested. However, each individual property method is mature and
not expected to change. Documentation and testing are huge strengths, and
it is intended to keep up the current quality of both.

A numer of features have been worked on but are not yet included in this 
library, not ordered by any priority:

Phase equilibria according to activity coefficient methods (NRTL, UNIQUAC, 
Wilson, Van Laar, Margules). Functionality has been tentatively created, but
is not included due to the lack of coefficient databases. Suggestions would
be very welcome. UNIFAC has been tested, but is also ont included due to
lack of automatic group contribution assignment.

Rigorous equations of state for excess properties, and phase equilibria.
Tested EOSs are PR, LK, VdW, SRK, BWRS, and a few others. The holdup here
is the determination of analytical expressions for their partial 
derivatives of mixtures. SymPy is imensely helpful, and has been used to
successfully obtain specific values of those derivatives at specific points.
Unfortunately, most listed forms as in Walas (1985) are incorrect. If
expressions are not eventually found, this will be implemented with numerical
derivatives only.

Fundamental Equations of State. The IAPWS-95 model, and that of 20 fluids
in "Short Fundamental Equations of State for 20 Industrial Fluids" have
been implemented. However, they are quite slow in Python - taking 2-10 ms
to solve. This can be reduced to ~1-2 ms if Cython is used, however, this
means that distribution through PyPi because harder. Suggestions about
this are welcome. Currently, the phenomenal library CoolProp is used instead;
which has already been packaged for PyPi. Even if custom code is released
for these EOS, CoolProp will remain prioritized; developed in C++, it is
simply much faster than code can be in pure Python.

Electrolyte models. The Pitzer, Bromley, and LIQUAC models have been in
development along with parameter databases for them. The ion database
currently has ~300 species, few of them with much data available.
Phase eqlibria with these models is also in progress.

Safety information, regulatory information, and economic data for chemicals.
This functionality has been included, but is not yet very mature. This is 
a low priority.

Development follows pep8 and uses pytest for testing. Both Python 2 and 3 are
supported.
