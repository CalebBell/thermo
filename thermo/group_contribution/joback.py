This module contains an implementation of the Joback group-contribution method.
This functionality requires the RDKit library to work.

For submitting pull requests,
please use the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo/>`_.

.. warning::
    The Joback class method does not contain all the groups for every chemical.
    There are often multiple ways of fragmenting a chemical. Other times, the
    fragmentation algorithm will fail. These limitations are present in both
    the implementation and the method itself. You are welcome to seek to
    improve this code but no to little help can be offered.

class Joback:
    r'''Class for performing chemical property estimations with the Joback
    group contribution method as described in [1]_ and [2]_. This is a very
    common method with low accuracy but wide applicability. This routine can be
    used with either its own automatic fragmentation routine, or user specified
    groups. It is applicable to organic compounds only, and has only 41 groups
    with no interactions between them. Each method's documentation describes
    its accuracy. The automatic fragmentation routine is possible only because
    of the development of SMARTS expressions to match the Joback groups by
    Dr. Jason Biggs. The list of SMARTS expressions
    was posted publically on the
    `RDKit mailing list <https://www.mail-archive.com/rdkit-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07446.html>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mol : rdkitmol or smiles str
        Input molecule for the analysis, [-]
    atom_count : int, optional
        The total number of atoms including hydrogen in the molecule; this will
        be counted by rdkit if it not provided, [-]
    MW : float, optional
        Molecular weight of the molecule; this will be calculated by rdkit if
        not provided, [g/mol]
    Tb : float, optional
        An experimentally known boiling temperature for the chemical; this
        increases the accuracy of the calculated critical point if provided.
        [K]

    Notes
    -----
    Be sure to check the status of the automatic fragmentation; not all
    chemicals with the Joback method are applicable.

    Approximately 68% of chemcials in the thermo database seem to be able to
    be estimated with the Joback method.

    If a group which was identified is missign a regressed contribution, the
    estimated property will be None. However, if not all atoms of a molecule
    are identified as particular groups, property estimation will go ahead
    with heavily reduced accuracy. Check the `status` attribute to be sure
    a molecule was properly fragmented.

    Examples
    --------
    Analysis of Acetone:

    >>> J = Joback('CC(=O)C') # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> J.Hfus(J.counts) # doctest:+SKIP
    5125.0
    >>> J.Cpig(350) # doctest:+SKIP
    84.69109750000001
    >>> J.status # doctest:+SKIP
    'OK'

    All properties can be obtained in one go with the `estimate` method:

    >>> J.estimate(callables=False) # doctest:+SKIP
    {'Tb': 322.11, 'Tm': 173.5, 'Tc': 500.5590049525365, 'Pc': 4802499.604994407, 'Vc': 0.0002095, 'Hf': -217829.99999999997, 'Gf': -154540.00000000003, 'Hfus': 5125.0, 'Hvap': 29018.0, 'mul_coeffs': [839.1099999999998, -14.99], 'Cpig_coeffs': [7.520000000000003, 0.26084, -0.0001207, 1.545999999999998e-08]}


    The results for propionic anhydride (if the status is not OK) should not be
    used.

    >>> J = Joback('CCC(=O)OC(=O)CC') # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> J.status # doctest:+SKIP
    'Matched some atoms repeatedly: [4]'
    >>> J.Cpig(300) # doctest:+SKIP
    175.85999999999999

    None of the routines need to use the automatic routine; they can be used
    manually too:

    >>> Joback.Tb({1: 2, 24: 1})
    322.11
