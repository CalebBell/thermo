def legal_status(CASRN, method=None, get_methods=False, CASi=None):

    method or with all methods.

    Returns either the status as a string for a specified method, or the
    status of the chemical in all available data sources, in the format
    {source: status}.

    Parameters
    ----------
    CASRN : string
        CASRN [-]

    Returns
    -------
    status : str or dict
        Legal status information [-]
    methods : list, only returned if get_methods == True
        List of methods which can be used to obtain legal status with the
        given inputs

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    method : string, optional
        A string for the method name to use, as defined by constants in
        legal_status_methods
    get_methods : bool, optional
        If True, function will determine which methods can be used to obtain
        the legal status for the desired chemical, and will return methods
        instead of the status
    CASi : int, optional
        CASRN as an integer, used internally [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Supported methods are:

        * **DSL**: Canada Domestic Substance List, [1]_. As extracted on Feb 11, 2015
          from a html list. This list is updated continuously, so this version
          will always be somewhat old. Strictly speaking, there are multiple
          lists but they are all bundled together here. A chemical may be
          'Listed', or be on the 'Non-Domestic Substances List (NDSL)',
          or be on the list of substances with 'Significant New Activity (SNAc)',
          or be on the DSL but with a 'Ministerial Condition pertaining to this
          substance', or have been removed from the DSL, or have had a
          Ministerial prohibition for the substance.
        * **TSCA**: USA EPA Toxic Substances Control Act Chemical Inventory, [2]_.
          This list is as extracted on 2016-01. It is believed this list is
          updated on a periodic basis (> 6 month). A chemical may simply be
          'Listed', or may have certain flags attached to it. All these flags
          are described in the dict TSCA_flags.
        * **EINECS**: European INventory of Existing Commercial chemical
          Substances, [3]_. As extracted from a spreadsheet dynamically
          generated at [1]_. This list was obtained March 2015; a more recent
          revision already exists.
        * **NLP**: No Longer Polymers, a list of chemicals with special
          regulatory exemptions in EINECS. Also described at [3]_.
        * **SPIN**: Substances Prepared in Nordic Countries. Also a boolean
          data type. Retrieved 2015-03 from [4]_.

    Other methods which could be added are:

        * Australia: AICS Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances
        * China: Inventory of Existing Chemical Substances Produced or Imported
          in China (IECSC)
        * Europe: REACH List of Registered Substances
        * India: List of Hazardous Chemicals
        * Japan: ENCS: Inventory of existing and new chemical substances
        * Korea: Existing Chemicals Inventory (KECI)
        * Mexico: INSQ National Inventory of Chemical Substances in Mexico
        * New Zealand:  Inventory of Chemicals (NZIoC)
        * Philippines: PICCS Philippines Inventory of Chemicals and Chemical
          Substances
