def dipole_moment(CASRN, AvailableMethods=False, Method=None):
    r'''This function handles the retrieval of a chemical's dipole moment.
    Lookup is based on CASRNs. Will automatically select a data source to use
    if no Method is provided; returns None if the data is not available.

    Prefered source is 'CCCBDB'. Considerable variation in reported data has
    found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    CASRN : string
        CASRN [-]

    Returns
    -------
    dipole : float
        Dipole moment, [debye]
    methods : list, only returned if AvailableMethods == True
        List of methods which can be used to obtain dipole moment with the
        given inputs

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    Method : string, optional
        The method name to use. Accepted methods are 'CCCBDB', 'MULLER', or
        'POLING'. All valid values are also held in the list `dipole_methods`.
    AvailableMethods : bool, optional
        If True, function will determine which methods can be used to obtain
        the dipole moment for the desired chemical, and will return methods
        instead of the dipole moment

    Notes
    -----
    A total of three sources are available for this function. They are:

        * 'CCCBDB', a series of critically evaluated data for compounds in
          [1]_, intended for use in predictive modeling.
        * 'MULLER', a collection of data in a
          group-contribution scheme in [2]_.
        * 'POLING', in the appendix in [3].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dipole_moment(CASRN='64-17-5')
    1.44
