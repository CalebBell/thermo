    Returns None if the data is not available.

    Function has data for 571 chemicals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    CASRN : string
        CASRN [-]

    Returns
    -------

    ----------------
    Method : string, optional
        A string for the method name to use, as defined by constants in
        Hf_methods
    AvailableMethods : bool, optional
        If True, function will determine which methods can be used to obtain
        Hf for the desired chemical, and will return methods instead of Hf

    Notes
    -----
    Only one source of information is available to this function. it is:

        * 'API_TDB', a compilation of heats of formation of unspecified phase.
          Not the original data, but as reproduced in [1]_. Some chemicals with
          duplicated CAS numbers were removed.
